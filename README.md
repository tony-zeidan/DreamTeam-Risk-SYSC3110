milestone 4 phase

[UML](https://lucid.app/invitations/accept/fdd00eb0-1f04-4212-8db9-c9dd045a9c40)

### Changes in Milestone 4
* we now added support for custom maps
* support for saving/loading maps as well as new games on any map
* we did this through the implementing of JSON serialization
* we now added select sound effects for the game
* we now added player icons into the game (Among Us icons)

### Custom Maps
* we have included a custom map in the deployment zip called "sinnoh.world"
* this custom map should only be accessed through the "new game" button on the home screen
* this custom map can then be saved and reloaded through the "load game" button on the home screen
* the same procedure can be applied to the "default.world" map

### JSON Serialization
In this Milestone we used JSON serialization throughout the entire project.
All maps (.world) as well as all saved games (.save) have their data stored in JSON format.
To implement this behaviour, we used an external library called "json-simple" which is included
in Gradle as a dependency.
The deserialization/loading game was quite custom, this was because we used the same algorithm for
deserializing custom maps as well as deserializing non-custom maps.
You may see this in the "build.gradle" file within our project on GitHub.

### File Explanations
For this Milestone we created our own custom file extensions.
We used ".world" files and ".save" files. Both of these types are actually ".zip" files and they can be renamed as such.
The files contained within these two types of ".zip" files can be seen below.

#### .world
- map.png : an image of the map to be played on
- map.json : map data for the loading of the map instance (only territories and coordinates)

#### .save
- map.png : an image of the map to be played on
- map.json : map data for the loading of the map instance (only territories and coordinates)
- game.json : game data for the loading of the game instance (contains players, owned territories, game phase, etc...)

### TA Notes
In order to run this program, you should unzip the deployment folder we sent.
Then in order for optimal results, navigate to the extracted folder in command line and finally execute the JAR file.
We have included a testing invalid map that will throw an error when loading.
To save optimally make sure the extension of the file you are saving is of ".save" and that this is done in the
"worlds/saved_games" directory.

Although we can't say for sure, the proper way to load this project into IntelliJ would be like any other project,
then what you would do is the "Import Gradle Project" task that can be found using a global search (only if you have Gradle plugin).
Then it would take a while to import all dependencies and such.

From there you should see a Gradle window on the right side, in which you can run the predefined Gradle tasks we implemented.
Under "build" you can see the "runShadow" task which creates a JAR and runs it (as described in Lab 9).

You most likely will be able to run the JAR in the deployment folder we gave you through the command line though.

Also note that in the directory "worlds\world_maps" we included folder containing the contents of the ".world"
files so that it wouldn't be necessary to unzip to look at the contents.

We hope that this is easy to understand and that it doesn't take much time to implement.

### How to Use
Look at Manual PDF.
    
### Milestones
- [x] Milestone 1: A text-based playable version of the game, i.e., players should be able to play the game via the console using the keyboard.
    >A text-based playable version of the game, i.e., players should be able to
     play the game via the console using the keyboard. There should be a command to print
     the state of the map (i.e., which player is in which country and with how many armies), a
     command to decide which country to attack from which country, and a command to pass
     your turn to the next player. Events such as the outcome of an attack, whose turn it is to
     play, the elimination of a player, etc. should be printed to the console when applicable.
     Also required, the UML modeling of the problem domain (class diagrams with complete
     variable and method signatures, and sequence diagrams for important scenarios), detailed
     description of the choice of data structures and relevant operations: you are providing an
     initial design and implementation for the Model part of the MVC. Do not worry about
     any GUI yet.
    - Deliverables: readme file (see explanation below) + code (source + executable in
      a jar file) + UML diagrams + documentation, all in one zip file. 
    - Deadline: Friday Oct 23rd. Weight: 15% of the overall project grade.
    
- [x] Milestone 2: A GUI-based version of the game using Java Swing components.
    > GUI-based version (now you’re adding the View and the Controller!) of the
      game. Display must be in a JFrame, and user input is via the mouse. You have freedom
      for other GUI decisions. Also required: Unit tests for the Model. 
    - Deliverables: readme file + design + corresponding tests + code + documentation,
      all in one zip file. In particular, document the changes you made to your UML
      and data structures from Milestone 1 and explain why. 
    - Deadline: Monday November 9th. Weight: 20% of the overall project grade.

- [x] Milestone 3: Addition of army placement, troupe movement phase, etc...
    >  Additional features: bonus army placement + troupe movement phase +
      “AI” player. As per the rules of Risk, at the beginning of a player’s turn, the player
      receives reinforcement armies proportional to the number of countries held (total
      territories divided by 3, with a minimum of 3) and bonus armies for holding whole 
      continents (number depending on the size of the continent, see rules for exact numbers).
      The player must place these reinforcement armies before moving on to the attack phase.
      The troupe movement phase occurs after the attack phase; the player can decide to move
      any number of armies from one country to another “connected” country (“connected”
      meaning that there must be a path between the two countries that only goes through
      countries held by the player making the move). As for the “AI” player: any number of the
      players in the game can be assigned to be an “AI” player. The way the “AI” player plays
      is up to you. One possible way is to first come up with a function that assesses how
      “good” a given state of the board is (in terms of countries held, armies, etc.), that is called
      a utility function. In a game that involves some uncertainty due to dice rolls, one simple
      yet effective AI method is to make it choose the action that maximizes the expected
      utility. 
    - Deliverables: readme file + code + corresponding tests + refined design +
      documentation. The program must work robustly, and the code must be “smellfree” (we will be hunting for smells!). Make sure that you document the changes
      since the last iteration, and the reason for those changes.
    - Deadline: Monday November 23rd. Weight: 30% of the overall project grade
    
- [x] Milestone 4: Addition of saving / loading features
    > Two more things: 1- Save/load features. You may use Java Serialization to
     achieve this. 2- Custom maps. The custom map may be defined in XML or JSON format.
     Upon loading of a custom map, the program should be able to reject invalid maps, e.g.
     maps where certain countries or groups of countries are unreachable.
    - Deliverables: readme file + code + tests + documentation. Your project should be
      well packaged, and the program(s) should be easy to install and run.
    - Deadline: Monday December 7th. Weight: 35% of the overall project grade.

> Milestones must contain all necessary files and documentation, even those items that are
  unchanged from previous milestones. Missing files cannot be submitted after the
  deadline, no exceptions. Verify that your submission contains all necessary files (in
  particular, don’t forget to include your source code!) before submitting on cuLearn.
  The “readme” file, listed as a deliverable for each iteration, is typically a short text file
  that lists and describes: the rest of the deliverables, the authors, the changes that were
  made since the previous deliverable, the known issues (known issues are graded less
  severely than undocumented ones!) and the roadmap ahead.
  “Documentation” includes up-to-date UML diagrams, detailed descriptions of design
  decisions made, complete user manuals, and javadoc documentation.
